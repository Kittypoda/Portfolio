        Hei, jeg heter Oda
        </h1>
        <p>
        I live in a pink house, tucked away in a forest by a Norwegian fjord, where I study front-end development and build on my background in graphic design.<br></br>Iâ€™m passionate about crafting beautiful and intuitive user experiences, focusing on designing clean, inspiring digital interfaces that feel effortless to use. With a keen eye for detail and a deep appreciation for aesthetics, I bridge the gap between design and development, ensuring seamless, accessible, and engaging interactions.
